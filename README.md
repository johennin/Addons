My journey in learning how to code LUA and World of Warcraft addons.

# CrushedCritAnnouncer
A simple addon that displays the most recent crit or crushing blow. Useful for tanking to alert when more damage than normal is coming or if you have the wrong geared equipped. (You can permanently avoid crits and crushing in raids and instances by defense and avoidance cap but it might not always be possible)
